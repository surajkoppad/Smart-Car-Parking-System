# Verilog Car Parking System

## Abstract

This project implements a Verilog-based car parking system designed to enhance parking management efficiency. At the entrance or exit of the parking facility, drivers are required to enter a password for access control. The gate opens only upon correct password entry. The system also provides real-time displays of vacant and available parking slots, along with navigation guidance to the selected parking spot.

## Introduction

In urban areas, drivers searching for parking contribute significantly to traffic congestion, estimated at about 30%. Historically, cities, businesses, and property developers have endeavored to match parking supply with growing demand. A Parking System leverages advanced technologies such as vehicle sensors, wireless communications, and data analytics for improved traffic control and efficient parking management. Recent advancements in mobile applications, mobile UPI payments, and in-car GPS navigation systems further enhance the usability and effectiveness of parking systems.

The core of a modern parking system lies in its ability to access, collect, analyze, and utilize real-time information on parking usage. This capability empowers parking managers and drivers to optimize parking capacity utilization effectively.

## Motivation to Use Parking Systems

1. **Reduced Pollution:** Efficient parking systems decrease driving time, thereby reducing vehicle emissions and mitigating environmental impact.

2. **Enhanced User Experience:** Smart parking solutions integrate various functionalities like payment, spot identification, location search, and notifications into a seamless user experience.

3. **Optimized Parking:** Users save time and effort by quickly finding the best available parking spots, benefiting both commercial and corporate entities through efficient space utilization.

4. **Reduced Traffic:** Guiding drivers directly to available parking spots minimizes traffic congestion caused by aimless searching.

5. **Increased Safety:** Real-time data and surveillance capabilities improve security by preventing violations and suspicious activities in parking lots, thereby enhancing overall safety.

6. **Real-Time Data Insights:** Continuous data analysis provides valuable insights into usage patterns, enabling informed decision-making for parking facility management.

7. **Decreased Management Costs:** Automation reduces labor costs and resource consumption associated with manual parking management processes.

## Conclusion

The goal of this project was to develop an effective smart car parking system capable of adapting to various applications. The system simplifies parking operations by ensuring accurate identification of vehicles and emphasizing parking safety. Drivers benefit from streamlined parking processes, including easy selection of parking spots.
